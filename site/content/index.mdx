    <Article title="Background">
    Crossroads is a tool to generate a single executable file to host any application and its content. It is an important component of the Morgan Stanley Modern Desktop Development Platform called ComposeUI. While .NET applications do have a native option to be self contained, this tool brings that feature to Node.js, Python, Java, etc applications as well. This way applications can be distributable without requiring local installation or an app store. Applications can be packaged for both Windows and Linux by using just one tool.
